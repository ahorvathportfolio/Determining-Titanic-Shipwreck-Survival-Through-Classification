# Determining-Titanic-Shipwreck-Survival-Through-Classification
The prediction of categorical responses is a major area of practical and theoretical study. Probabilistic 
classification is a supervised learning procedure by which the probability that an individual observation 
belongs to a certain class of a categorical response variable is used to establish rules to classify future 
observations. This paper seeks to explore the use of probabilistic classification methods such as logistic 
regression, naive bayes, different methods based on assuming Normal populations, and other more general 
methods such as classification trees to determine the survival of individuals from the Titanic shipwreck.
